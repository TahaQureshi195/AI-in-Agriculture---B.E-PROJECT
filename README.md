# AI-in-Agriculture-B.E-PROJECT
** B.E Project My final Project in Engineering was “AI in agriculture - By Plant Disease Recognition” in which I lead a team of four, and my contributions in the Project include Hardware Programming of Sensors working with (DHT11 -temperature Sensor ,FC-28 - moisture sensor , MCP3008-ADC,V.2 Module ,etc.) to detect the parameters &amp; to upload them to platforms like Thinkspeak, Firebase and fetching useful data in form of graphs and statistics . 

From Firebase data was sent to the Web Application where the disease of the Plant is detected by the CNN Algorithm handled by the software side members and lastly, I also got actively involved in the plant disease feedback mechanism, packaging and boxing of the project to get a final end-product.
